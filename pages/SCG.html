        <h3>SCG (Social and Communication Guidelines) - are guidelines to do zero-danger communication and social interactions</h3>
        <h3>The purpose of SCG is to do anything without any risk to get doxxed or get banned/kicked/muted or hated</h3>
        <h3>Or for surviving or escaping a drama or conflict</h3>
        <br>

            <h1>1. Polarization</h1>
        </div>
        <h3>Polarization - is a state of being divided into two or more groups</h3>
        <h3>Everything can be polarized - politics, religion, race, gender, etc</h3>
        <h3>The basics mostly for the virtual world but can be used on real in some way or another</h3>
        <h3>Exists two sides of internet: high polarazied and low polarized</h3>
        <h3>You can use modular social masking (in chapter 2) so you can speak with people from both sides</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>High Polarazied Environment (HPE) is a place where you can create dialogs easily</h3>
        <h3>But at the same time most dangerous and fun environment</h3>
        <h3>This allows to be in the center of the conversation by creating a new topic about 1 of groups</h3>
        <h3>All people is very different from other groups so created decentralized environment like reddit, discord or 90-s blogs</h3>
        <h3>Where all people polarazied the same way inside, but in centralized high polarized environment can be chaotic</h3>
        <h3>Easpacilly if polarazied topic is controversial, and people from both sides gonna fight with each other</h3>
        <h3>If you can't stay neutral (about this in future) and you in not required spotlight you can try to move to another controversial topic</h3>
        <h3>A topic that easier for you and attempt 2 to be neutral</h3>
        <h3>Also you can create a discussions for entertainment, when people each at other from both sides and you being neutral watching it</h3>
        <h3>To make this you can start a controversial topic (keep in mind that works only in chat-like like discort) and try to stay neutral</h3>
        <h3>With right setup you can make people do conflict for everything, and just get fun or escape for excess spotlight</h3>
        <h3>If you don't care about morale compass when to get spotlight you can make ragebait (i don't recommend that)</h3>
        <h3>High polarazied environments are almost died today</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Low Polarized Environment (LPE) in another hand, is a place where all is the same</h3>
        <h3>Where dominance in one side or theres all neutral and highly censored</h3>
        <h3>Examples or LPE / half-LPE: instagram, real life, youtube, tiktok</h3>
        <h3>This place more safe, but is also less fun and harder to create new dialogs</h3>
        <h3>The reason is because poeple are mostly act the same, they like robots that do nothing</h3>
        <h3>Here do nothing in fact because the main target to be safe is stay neutral, again</h3>
        <h3>Stayng neutral is tactic to escape spotlight, this means don't do anything, or say that you don't know about this sides</h3>
        <h3>Don't be scared to lie. Don't go to polarized toughts. Or you can just say you don't care about both sides and create</h3>
        <h3>A discussion with fighing with both sides (works only in HPE because there's a sides)</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>HPE (unstable state) is always go to LPE (stable state) with time</h3>
        <h3>And remember that 1 mistake and it will stay in internet history forever!</h3>

            <h1>2. Modular Social Masking (MSM)</h1>
        </div>
        <h3>You have a person that hate a thing that you like and person that like that thing</h3>
        <h3>What you do? Modular Social Masking (MSM) - is a way to manipulate personality based on situation</h3>
        <h3>It's basically just liying to yourself and other people about your personality</h3>
        <h3>So you can say you hate this thing too, but for other person that you like it</h3>
        <h3>If it's HPE environment you can say you never know what it is so you can escape from spotlight</h3>
        <h3>With MSM you can be in diferent sides at the same time, or escape from any situation</h3>
        <h3>Or another way, be controversial saing against two sides at the time</h3>
        <h3>Just don't forget to remeber what personality from what place / situation</h3>
        <h3>Wrong personality in wrong time is bad idea, just remember that trust no one!</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>But what when you don't know what polarized or is it at all? You can determ what MSM use with careful hearing about item</h3>
        <h3>NEVER ASK DIRECTLY! DON'T SAY OR MENTION ABOUT ITEM! JUST LISTEN AND WATCH!</h3>
        <h3>You can ask sneaky questions about item not directly, exists few methods to do it</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>- No-both indirect question (Something like "What's twig (stick) mean?"),</h3>
        <h3>when people can't know that you know about item but dependent on answer you can</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>- Yes-both indirect question (Something like drawing specific picture with "Write what on it"),</h3>
        <h3>when people can know that you know about item and dependent on answer you can</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>And remember that 1 mistake and it will stay in internet history forever!</h3>

            <h1>3. Community Classification Systems</h1>
        </div>
        <h3>Community Classification Systems (CCS) - is a way to classify people based on their determination and behaviour</h3>
        <h3>Understanding CCS allows understand how people think, and predict stereotypes or working with then</h3>
        <h3>Basically it's has 4 levels of level of determination or activism</h3>
        <h3>Numbers of communities always is multiple of 2, because of bi-polarization into two sides: haters and community itself</h3>
        <h3>(In red triangle in image is a radioactivity/toxicity sign, bad draw skills)</h3>
        <img src="../assets/slide1.png">
        <h3>level 0 (null/undefined) - A person that not part of community</h3>
        <h3>It can be neutral, support, not care or hate, nothing special</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>level 1 (part of) - A person that a part of community</h3>
        <h3>It's understandle. But people from level 0 somethimes can assign a stereotypes or misunderstanding because of levels above</h3>
        <h3>Event if person don't fit to the stereotype, but they very rare is even a reason for stereotype</h3>
        <h3>They can be oposite of the stereotype or your exceptions because of how people are different</h3>
        <h3>You can't know for sure if person is part of community or not, unless they say about it or in some minor thing</h3>
        <h3>Example of the minor thing: "I use arch btw!" or a flag on avatar, etc.</h3>
        <h3>They can understand why steoereotype exists and can have hating some clans in community (about this in chapter 4)</h3>
        <h3>And have a good live, it's hard know how many of them and you never find they in most of the time</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>level 2 (deep) - A person that too match in the community</h3>
        <h3>They mostly reason for some stereotypes or even most in some times</h3>
        <h3>You know from the distance that poeple are part of the community in 100% percent, unlike from 1 level where it can be 50% maximum</h3>
        <h3>They always show pictures, logos and symbols of the community and sais more about it, too much in facts, no matter how much important</h3>
        <h3>They like everyone in community and more likely given priviliges to poeple in community, ratser than equaly</h3>
        <h3>They just scream at people about stereotypes and they can be source of the stereotype, but they rare</h3>
        <h3>And probably do stopid things and annoying to people from levels 1 and 0</h3>
        <h3>They have change to be chronicaly online so they easier to find</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>level 3 (extreme/danger) - The most rare type of person, probably the source of sterotypes and reason to ruin image of community</h3>
        <h3>They ALWAYS toxic and destructive for everyone, even community probably can have then, they arguments makes no sense</h3>
        <h3>And they place community in the first place, even higher than lives of millions, the often a karens, zoo/pedo-philes</h3>
        <h3>Or criminals that do something illegal, this poeple somethimes even damage a internet and create massive hate to the community</h3>
        <h3>They must be elliminated (digital or physicaly) for everyone happines</h3>
        <h3>You don't need to find them, they come for you in the house</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>The 1/2/3 ratio can be different for each community, and everyone for each one based on they</h3>
        <h3>World inside, or world outside. For example 1%:95%:4% ratio for gen alpha or 70%:25%:5% for lgbt or feminism<h3>
        <h3>and 50%:40%:10% christians, this just example and can be not real ratios, it's just example</h3>
        <h3>It's very important to know the ratio of the community so you know what to expect</h3>
        <h3>Also demographics can play role for example ru#ians are level 3 and they must burn in hell</h3>

            <h1>4. Community building tree</h1>
        </div>
        <h3>Community always present as a whole but in 100% they split inside to the sub-communities</h3>
        <h3>They can building as a tree (like linux-distros), some sub-communities can don't like other sub-communities</h3>
        <h3>Some can have multiple sub-comminities, some level 1 person that newbie or years in community</h3>
        <h3>Can like or be part of multiple sub-communities, even if sub-communities don't like each other</h3>
        <h3>But all sub-communities have common umbrella of the community</h3>
        <h3>They mostly share levels ratio, but they can be different too</h3>
        <h3>But if you talk about sub-communities you can talk to then as community, because they shear the same traits and methods</h3>
        <h3>That community struct-trait do</h3>
        <h3>If community have a indetification symbols (flag, icon, name, logo, trademark, etc)</h3>
        <h3>Sub-communities can have the same symbols too, but can have other personal symbols too</h3>
        <h3>Sub-community that are cult can be too so be careful</h3>
